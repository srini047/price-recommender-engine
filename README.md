- This project is designed mainly for people who are fed up with comparing the prices of different items in e-commerce websites like amazon and Flipkart.
- We have made that task very simple with the help of this project.
- This takes input from users about the product and displays the relevant products from both websites.
- If the user is not satisfied with the product displayed then with the recommended suggestions user could select the product.
- Then there is a link to the product displayed so that it redirects directly into it without much hustle in comparing the prices.
- To make it intuitive we have used GUI to make the user interface more interactive and user friendly.
- To achieve it we have coded entirely in python and used the required libraries like tkinter, bs4 (beautifulsoup), requests, get_close_matches, webbrowser, and collections.
- To make it ever-usable we can predict the prices of newly launched products as well so that without any code updating needed it can easily tackle it.
